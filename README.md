# Image-Stegano 
#### A tool to analyze and implement various image steganography methods

"Steganography is the art and science of communicating in a way which hides the existence of the
communication. In contrast to Cryptography, where the enemy is allowed to detect, intercept and modify
messages without being able to violate certain security premises guaranteed by the cover message with
the embedded cryptosystem. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless
messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message
present". In image steganography the information is hidden exclusively in images.
